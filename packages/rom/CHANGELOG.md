### Minor Changes

- [#57](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/57) [`b4359a3`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/b4359a3df854de73243a37d06ee8d53a4d469b94) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Add a **"Generate subfolders based on Daz scenes"** toggle to the character
  editor's Export directory panel. When on, the generated Daz script resolves the
  open scene at run time via `Scene.getFilename()` and nests the export under a
  subfolder named after it (the exporter's own `<characterName>` subfolder is
  created inside that) — so a character's scene/outfit variants export side by
  side. Falls back to the export root when no scene is saved. Adds
  `exportSceneSubfolders` to the character schema (→ `CHARACTER_SCHEMA_VERSION` 4).

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- [#55](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/55) [`9c2bbf4`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/9c2bbf4c633fe930d05b21b929fca548044f61f8) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Integrate the DTH Exporter Plugin's new scripting hook (v1.8.1+). A character now
  has an **export directory** (editor → Export section); when set, the generated
  Daz script runs the exporter automatically after building the ROM —
  `dthExportAction.doExport(exportDir, characterName, referenceFrames, false)` — so
  one script builds _and_ exports, no dialog. The reference frames are derived from
  the ROM's reference-skeleton poses (the poses carrying a `referenceFbx`), passed
  space-separated. The exporter creates its own `<characterName>` subfolder, so the
  export directory should sit outside the project (the editor warns otherwise).
  Adds `exportPath` to the character schema (→ `CHARACTER_SCHEMA_VERSION` 3).

### Patch Changes

- [#55](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/55) [`9c2bbf4`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/9c2bbf4c633fe930d05b21b929fca548044f61f8) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Rename the generated PoseAsset CSV to DTH's convention: `<name>_pose_asset.csv`
  (was `<name>_PoseAsset.csv`). The legacy-cased file is cleaned up from the
  character folder and the export folder on the next generate.

### Minor Changes

- [#47](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/47) [`99ba2ba`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/99ba2ba0ef94c1ff76965f8607f1efe3023d20b2) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Character JSONs now carry their owning project's **name and library path**
  (`projectName` / `projectPath`), stamped on every save. Being a shape change,
  this bumps `CHARACTER_SCHEMA_VERSION` to **2** — characters last written before
  this (read as version 1) gain the fields on their next save.

- [#43](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/43) [`11d9b77`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/11d9b770b58a2ff059305e708df66bfe705a4c35) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Add a **character-JSON schema version**, independent of the app version. A new
  `CHARACTER_SCHEMA_VERSION` constant (starting at `1`) is stamped onto every saved
  character as `schemaVersion`. It changes only when the stored character shape
  changes (a field added, renamed, or removed) — pure app improvements leave it
  untouched. Existing JSONs without the field read as version `1`. This is the
  groundwork for a future migration framework: a stored version below the constant
  marks a definition that needs upgrading.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- [#40](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/40) [`2d28983`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/2d28983450883ccd0248d116b121a79d5b38518f) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Generalize the "Reset GP before applying extra frames" option: it's now **"Reset genitalia morphs before extra frames"** with a clear description, and it applies to whichever genital ROM is active — Golden Palace _or_ Dicktator — not just GP. The character field `resetGPBeforeApplying` was renamed to `resetGenBeforeApplying` (old definitions migrate automatically on load), and generation now emits the per-block reset flags the DTH runtime understands for both GP and DK.

- [#41](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/41) [`ce6d790`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/ce6d790f69901930ed48642636a527094167348c) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Generated Daz scripts are now installed into a per-character subfolder —
  `…/Scripts/DTH-Character-Studio/<project>/<character>/<Name>_<Genesis>.dsa` —
  instead of all sitting flat in the `DTH-Character-Studio` root. The DTH runtime
  (`.DthWorkflow.dsa` + `.DthUtils.dsa` + `.DthOptions.dsa`) is installed **once**
  in that root, and each character script now imports it from two levels up. A
  character rename moves its subfolder, and any flat-layout script left by an
  earlier version is cleaned up on the next generate.

The version is read from the app at runtime (blank in the web-only build).

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- [#32](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/32) [`528ba6f`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/528ba6fd041761fa29d5c4cd64f3b8394efe80a6) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Measure pose-asset ROM frame lengths on the fly from the actual `.duf` files instead of hard-coding them. A native command (`pose_asset_frames`) reads each preset's DSON (gunzipping if needed) and returns `round(maxKeyTime × 30) + 1`; the base ROM, Golden Palace, Dicktator and Physics blocks are all measured per character — so custom assets (e.g. a user's own JCM `.duf`) work exactly like the DTH ones, and the generated PoseAsset CSV frame offsets are always correct. The editor's absolute frame numbers re-measure live as preset/custom selections change. Generation **hard-errors** if an included asset can't be read (never a silently wrong-length ROM); the `BASE_FRAMES_*`/`GP_FRAMES`/`DK_FRAMES`/`PHYS_FRAMES` constants are gone.

Houdini projects are linked in place and never copied, so their stored absolute import paths keep working. New characters get an empty Houdini folder seeded so there is an obvious place to save the project — both the folder name and whether it is created are configurable in Settings.

- [#22](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/22) [`55fd976`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/55fd976ef77eaa6c6b9f9c135a0f48e537a2be72) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Characters can now link more than one Daz scene. Adding a scene from outside the character folder offers to copy or move it into a chosen subfolder, the scene folder can be relinked if it is renamed outside the app, and each scene can be unlinked (optionally deleting it from disk). Every scene shows as a card with its Daz `.tip.png` portrait, and clicking it opens the scene in Daz Studio.

  (it sits on its own row below the settings instead of being squeezed beside the
  Genesis-specific box), so long paths are fully visible. Characters created from a
  Daz scene now record that scene's path, shown read-only as a **Daz scene** field
  beneath the Filepath. Adds an optional `scenePath` to the character schema
  (empty for characters made before the scene-based create flow).

Adds in-app auto-update (GitHub Releases) and a changesets-driven release pipeline.
