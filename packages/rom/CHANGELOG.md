### Minor Changes

- [#22](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/22) [`55fd976`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/55fd976ef77eaa6c6b9f9c135a0f48e537a2be72) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Characters can now link Houdini projects and open them directly in Houdini. Houdini projects are linked in place and never copied, so their stored absolute import paths keep working. New characters get an empty Houdini folder seeded so there is an obvious place to save the project — both the folder name and whether it is created are configurable in Settings.

- [#22](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/22) [`55fd976`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/55fd976ef77eaa6c6b9f9c135a0f48e537a2be72) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Characters can now link more than one Daz scene. Adding a scene from outside the character folder offers to copy or move it into a chosen subfolder, the scene folder can be relinked if it is renamed outside the app, and each scene can be unlinked (optionally deleting it from disk). Every scene shows as a card with its Daz `.tip.png` portrait, and clicking it opens the scene in Daz Studio.

### Minor Changes

- [#16](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/16) [`99a888e`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/99a888e51d0d338f22692d3ec7ae9a2294ad2687) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Character editor: the **Filepath** field now spans the full width of the card
  (it sits on its own row below the settings instead of being squeezed beside the
  Genesis-specific box), so long paths are fully visible. Characters created from a
  Daz scene now record that scene's path, shown read-only as a **Daz scene** field
  beneath the Filepath. Adds an optional `scenePath` to the character schema
  (empty for characters made before the scene-based create flow).

- [#2](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/2) [`7131015`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/71310154dfd5b07d4f2d1f150c0a66e5c6ac652d) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Migrate the desktop runtime from Electron to Tauri 2, convert the frontend to a client-rendered SPA, and restructure into a 2-layer monorepo: `@dth/web` (SPA frontend), `@dth/desktop` (Tauri shell), `@dth/rom` (pure generation core). Adds in-app auto-update (GitHub Releases) and a changesets-driven release pipeline.
