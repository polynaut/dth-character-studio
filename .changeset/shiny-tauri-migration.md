Migrate the desktop runtime from Electron to Tauri 2, convert the frontend to a client-rendered SPA, and restructure into a 2-layer monorepo: `@dth/web` (SPA frontend), `@dth/desktop` (Tauri shell), `@dth/rom` (pure generation core). Adds in-app auto-update (GitHub Releases) and a changesets-driven release pipeline.
