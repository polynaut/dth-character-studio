Generalize the "Reset GP before applying extra frames" option: it's now **"Reset genitalia morphs before extra frames"** with a clear description, and it applies to whichever genital ROM is active — Golden Palace *or* Dicktator — not just GP. The character field `resetGPBeforeApplying` was renamed to `resetGenBeforeApplying` (old definitions migrate automatically on load), and generation now emits the per-block reset flags the DTH runtime understands for both GP and DK.
