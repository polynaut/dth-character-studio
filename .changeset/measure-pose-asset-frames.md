Measure pose-asset ROM frame lengths on the fly from the actual `.duf` files instead of hard-coding them. A native command (`pose_asset_frames`) reads each preset's DSON (gunzipping if needed) and returns `round(maxKeyTime × 30) + 1`; the base ROM, Golden Palace, Dicktator and Physics blocks are all measured per character — so custom assets (e.g. a user's own JCM `.duf`) work exactly like the DTH ones, and the generated PoseAsset CSV frame offsets are always correct. The editor's absolute frame numbers re-measure live as preset/custom selections change. Generation **hard-errors** if an included asset can't be read (never a silently wrong-length ROM); the `BASE_FRAMES_*`/`GP_FRAMES`/`DK_FRAMES`/`PHYS_FRAMES` constants are gone.
