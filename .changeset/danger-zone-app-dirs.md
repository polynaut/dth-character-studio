Danger zone (uninstall-Daz cleanup) tweaks:

- "Prefill folder paths" now also offers the Daz Studio app install folders `C:\Program Files\DAZ 3D\DAZStudio6` and `C:\Program Files\DAZ 3D\DAZStudio4`, so a full cleanup can also remove the application itself — not just its content/library folders.
- Prefill now adds the **full** standard-folder list regardless of whether each one currently exists (no longer filtered at prefill time). Existence is checked when deleting — missing folders are reported as "not found" — so the list stays complete no matter Daz's install state. The "Daz must be installed" info popup was removed accordingly.
