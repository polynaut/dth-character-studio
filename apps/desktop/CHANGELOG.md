### Minor Changes

- [`46703e1`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/46703e1a2478734fbe2281923eb497e3570b5be5) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - - **Native app menu** (desktop): **Main → Refresh assets / Exit** and **Help →
  About / Check for Updates**. Check for Updates now reports "you're on the latest
  version" / "not available in dev" when invoked from the menu.
  - **Avatar picker**: in the character image dialog, a row of linked Daz scene
    thumbnails lets you switch the main avatar to any scene's render. Avatars now use
    a content-versioned filename, so changing one live-updates everywhere (dialog,
    header, lists) without a reload.
  - **Tools**: the **DazToHue-Scripts** tab is now first and the default; its Save
    button is gone (it has no settings); a clear error with a **Settings** link shows
    when "My DAZ 3D Library" isn't set; and the intro links to the repo.
  - **About**: a paragraph crediting Soltude's **DazToHue-Scripts** (optional add-on)
    with a link straight to the in-app installer.

### Patch Changes

- [#85](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/85) [`0612d1f`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/0612d1f87b81d39f1d34f17f05f652fd85a668ce) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Fix: opening a linked Houdini project failed for `.hiplc` / `.hipnc` files with
  "Scoped command argument … failed regex validation". The shell `open` scope only
  matched `.hip` (anchored at the end), so the indie/non-commercial Houdini
  extensions were rejected. It now accepts `.hip`, `.hipnc`, and `.hiplc` (alongside
  `.duf` and http/https links).

### Minor Changes

- [#83](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/83) [`a51a795`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/a51a795db9bbbac2a12190226b3417904cbfb480) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Tools: add a **DazToHue-Scripts** tab that downloads the companion
  [soltude/DazToHue-Scripts](https://github.com/soltude/DazToHue-Scripts) repo — the
  Daz Studio scripts behind DTH Character Studio — straight from GitHub and installs
  it into `<My DAZ 3D Library>/Scripts/DazToHue-Scripts`. It delivers
  `DthScanFrames.dsa`, which exports the full morph list of an open Daz scene as a CSV
  you can pull into a character's ROM section via a section's **Import from CSV**.

  The download + unpack run natively (the webview can't fetch the archive — codeload's
  CORS only allows render.githubusercontent.com); GitHub's top-level wrapper folder is
  stripped, the zip is unpacked beside the destination and swapped in (so a failed
  download never leaves a half-written install), and re-installing replaces the folder
  with the latest version. Reuses the reqwest/rustls (ring) stack already in the build
  via the updater, so no new dependencies.

### Patch Changes

- [#83](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/83) [`a51a795`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/a51a795db9bbbac2a12190226b3417904cbfb480) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Fix: external links — the About page's GitHub link and links inside info popups —
  now open in the system browser. The shell `open` scope was limited to `.duf` /
  `.hip` paths, which silently rejected `https://` URLs; it now also allows http/https.

### Patch Changes

- [#81](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/81) [`0ecbcc6`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/0ecbcc6da374ef0198f615e6dfebadfa6f83fcc3) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Danger zone (uninstall-Daz cleanup) tweaks:

  - "Prefill folder paths" now also offers the Daz Studio app install folders `C:\Program Files\DAZ 3D\DAZStudio6` and `C:\Program Files\DAZ 3D\DAZStudio4`, so a full cleanup can also remove the application itself — not just its content/library folders.
  - Prefill now adds the **full** standard-folder list regardless of whether each one currently exists (no longer filtered at prefill time). Existence is checked when deleting — missing folders are reported as "not found" — so the list stays complete no matter Daz's install state. The "Daz must be installed" info popup was removed accordingly.

Wired into the new-character scene picker, the editor's Daz scenes and Houdini projects fields, and the avatar image dialog. Built on Tauri's native webview drag-drop (hit-tested to the pane under the cursor), so it works with real Explorer files (HTML5 file drops don't fire when the webview captures OS drops).

### Minor Changes

- [#32](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/32) [`528ba6f`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/528ba6fd041761fa29d5c4cd64f3b8394efe80a6) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Measure pose-asset ROM frame lengths on the fly from the actual `.duf` files instead of hard-coding them. A native command (`pose_asset_frames`) reads each preset's DSON (gunzipping if needed) and returns `round(maxKeyTime × 30) + 1`; the base ROM, Golden Palace, Dicktator and Physics blocks are all measured per character — so custom assets (e.g. a user's own JCM `.duf`) work exactly like the DTH ones, and the generated PoseAsset CSV frame offsets are always correct. The editor's absolute frame numbers re-measure live as preset/custom selections change. Generation **hard-errors** if an included asset can't be read (never a silently wrong-length ROM); the `BASE_FRAMES_*`/`GP_FRAMES`/`DK_FRAMES`/`PHYS_FRAMES` constants are gone.

- [#30](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/30) [`f3f70d4`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/f3f70d4a4578d60a459e79b63876d6bac5474096) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Reorganized the DazToHue settings into two self-contained panes: **Setup DTH Release** (DTH release selection + My DAZ 3D Library + Houdini documents folder + install) and **Setup DTH Exporter Plugin Release** (Exporter Plugin selection + Daz Studio install folder + install). Each has its own dry-run, gating, and report, and the admin-sensitive plugin step fails with a clear "close all Daz and Houdini apps and restart as administrator" message. The Exporter pane also reads the version already installed in the Daz plugins folder and shows up-to-date / update-available, labelling its button Install / Update / Reinstall accordingly. The DazToHue-Scripts folder moved to General settings.

### Minor Changes

- [#28](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/28) [`0bb2151`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/0bb2151e5c351d24f0b17b107bcba5349f420d3a) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Remember mapped network drives (X: → \\host\share) as you pick paths and re-map any that are missing on startup — so the app keeps working after you relaunch it as administrator, when Windows hides your interactive drive mappings from the elevated session. A new "Network drives" section in Settings → General lists them with their status, a manual re-map, and a Forget action.

  character's linked scene exists on disk, an "Open in Daz" button opens that
  `.duf` straight into Daz Studio. When the scene is missing (deleted or renamed)
  or was never linked, the button becomes "Link Daz scene": it opens a file picker
  and — if the chosen scene lives outside the project — offers (via the same modal
  as create) to copy it and its thumbnails into the character's folder. Linking
  persists immediately and refreshes the avatar from the new scene. The desktop
  shell `open` scope is widened to permit `.duf` paths (was http/tel/mailto only).

Adds in-app auto-update (GitHub Releases) and a changesets-driven release pipeline.
