- [#35](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/35) [`36310ad`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/36310ad1ff67db36af9348aebfe2c94373bcbaf4) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Native OS drag-and-drop for Daz scenes (`.duf`), Houdini projects (`.hip`/`.hipnc`/`.hiplc`) and the character avatar image: drag a file from Explorer onto the **pane** where it's added — the whole area is the drop target, no need to aim at the Browse button, and it highlights while a supported file hovers it. Wired into the new-character scene picker, the editor's Daz scenes and Houdini projects fields, and the avatar image dialog. Built on Tauri's native webview drag-drop (hit-tested to the pane under the cursor), so it works with real Explorer files (HTML5 file drops don't fire when the webview captures OS drops).

### Minor Changes

- [#32](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/32) [`528ba6f`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/528ba6fd041761fa29d5c4cd64f3b8394efe80a6) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Measure pose-asset ROM frame lengths on the fly from the actual `.duf` files instead of hard-coding them. A native command (`pose_asset_frames`) reads each preset's DSON (gunzipping if needed) and returns `round(maxKeyTime × 30) + 1`; the base ROM, Golden Palace, Dicktator and Physics blocks are all measured per character — so custom assets (e.g. a user's own JCM `.duf`) work exactly like the DTH ones, and the generated PoseAsset CSV frame offsets are always correct. The editor's absolute frame numbers re-measure live as preset/custom selections change. Generation **hard-errors** if an included asset can't be read (never a silently wrong-length ROM); the `BASE_FRAMES_*`/`GP_FRAMES`/`DK_FRAMES`/`PHYS_FRAMES` constants are gone.

- [#30](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/30) [`f3f70d4`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/f3f70d4a4578d60a459e79b63876d6bac5474096) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Reorganized the DazToHue settings into two self-contained panes: **Setup DTH Release** (DTH release selection + My DAZ 3D Library + Houdini documents folder + install) and **Setup DTH Exporter Plugin Release** (Exporter Plugin selection + Daz Studio install folder + install). Each has its own dry-run, gating, and report, and the admin-sensitive plugin step fails with a clear "close all Daz and Houdini apps and restart as administrator" message. The Exporter pane also reads the version already installed in the Daz plugins folder and shows up-to-date / update-available, labelling its button Install / Update / Reinstall accordingly. The DazToHue-Scripts folder moved to General settings.

### Minor Changes

- [#28](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/28) [`0bb2151`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/0bb2151e5c351d24f0b17b107bcba5349f420d3a) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Remember mapped network drives (X: → \\host\share) as you pick paths and re-map any that are missing on startup — so the app keeps working after you relaunch it as administrator, when Windows hides your interactive drive mappings from the elevated session. A new "Network drives" section in Settings → General lists them with their status, a manual re-map, and a Forget action.

- [#24](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/24) [`d6d1f1e`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/d6d1f1e01a20dfb0b4d3a6fec25287f253e193d9) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - One-click install of a DTH release and the Exporter Plugin into your local Daz Studio and Houdini — a native (Rust) port of the dth-cli install commands, with a dry-run preview and new optional settings for the Daz Studio install folder and the Houdini documents folder.

### Minor Changes

- [#16](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/16) [`99a888e`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/99a888e51d0d338f22692d3ec7ae9a2294ad2687) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Add **Open in Daz** / **Link Daz scene** to the character editor. When a
  character's linked scene exists on disk, an "Open in Daz" button opens that
  `.duf` straight into Daz Studio. When the scene is missing (deleted or renamed)
  or was never linked, the button becomes "Link Daz scene": it opens a file picker
  and — if the chosen scene lives outside the project — offers (via the same modal
  as create) to copy it and its thumbnails into the character's folder. Linking
  persists immediately and refreshes the avatar from the new scene. The desktop
  shell `open` scope is widened to permit `.duf` paths (was http/tel/mailto only).

### Minor Changes

- [#2](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/2) [`7131015`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/71310154dfd5b07d4f2d1f150c0a66e5c6ac652d) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Migrate the desktop runtime from Electron to Tauri 2, convert the frontend to a client-rendered SPA, and restructure into a 2-layer monorepo: `@dth/web` (SPA frontend), `@dth/desktop` (Tauri shell), `@dth/rom` (pure generation core). Adds in-app auto-update (GitHub Releases) and a changesets-driven release pipeline.
