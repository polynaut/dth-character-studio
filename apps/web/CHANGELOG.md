# @dth/web

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/2) [`7131015`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/71310154dfd5b07d4f2d1f150c0a66e5c6ac652d) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Separate app data from a user-owned character library. Settings and avatars stay
  in the app's private folder; each character now lives in its own folder
  (`<library>/<Name>/`) holding its definition **and** its generated files
  (`.dsa`, FBM JSON, PoseAsset CSV), inside a library folder the user picks and
  backs up. Adds a first-run folder picker, native folder pickers in Settings, and
  a per-character "Storage location" panel to view the absolute path and move a
  character into subfolders.

- [#2](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/2) [`7131015`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/71310154dfd5b07d4f2d1f150c0a66e5c6ac652d) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Migrate the desktop runtime from Electron to Tauri 2, convert the frontend to a client-rendered SPA, and restructure into a 2-layer monorepo: `@dth/web` (SPA frontend), `@dth/desktop` (Tauri shell), `@dth/rom` (pure generation core). Adds in-app auto-update (GitHub Releases) and a changesets-driven release pipeline.

### Patch Changes

- [#2](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/pull/2) [`7131015`](https://github.com/polynaut/dth-character-studio/commit/71310154dfd5b07d4f2d1f150c0a66e5c6ac652d) Thanks [@polynaut](https://github.com/polynaut)! - Store character avatars as a portable reference (a filename or an external URL) instead of a machine-specific asset URL, and resolve the loadable image at render time. Shared character JSON no longer embeds local paths, and a missing local avatar falls back to the initial-letter placeholder instead of a broken image. Legacy avatar values (old asset/Electron-route URLs) migrate to the new form on load.
